# kitchen-pal
a virtual recipe box

kitchen-pal is a small console program designed for that moment when you sit down to plan your meals and forget every dish you've ever liked. Store your favorite recipes in the SQLite database recipes.db. When you run kitchenPal.py, the program will suggest recipes from the database that you may accept or decline. After you have completed your selections, the program will generate a weekly shopping list.
